# Project-Euler-46

I am starting to learn Python. I have decided to do this by solving problems from the project euler (https://projecteuler.net/) list.

This is my solution to problem 46 https://projecteuler.net/problem=46. It's another brute force solution that works.

The algorithm is
- look at every odd number n = 2k+1 (smaller than 2*max+1 = 20001)
- if n is not prime


The value of max = 10000 has to be big enough to find a solution. This is an easy problem form the list, the people at project Euler were nice.
